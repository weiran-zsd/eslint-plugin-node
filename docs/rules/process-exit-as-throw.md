# Require that `process.exit()` expressions use the same code path as `throw` (`n/process-exit-as-throw`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): 🟢 `recommended-module`, ✅ `recommended-script`.

## 📖 Rule Details

```js
function foo(a) {
    if (a) {
        return new Bar();
    } else {
        process.exit(1);
    }
}
```

ESLint does not mark code after `process.exit()` calls as unreachable like it does with `throw` and `return` expressions, meaning rules like [consistent-return] will still warn.

This rule overrides the default code path analyzer so that code after `process.exit()` calls are marked as unreachable, meaning code like the above will not trigger warnings.

This rule itself never warn code.
