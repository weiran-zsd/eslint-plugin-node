# Disallow `import` declarations which import private modules (`n/no-unpublished-import`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): ☑️ `flat/recommended`, 🟢 `flat/recommended-module`, ✅ `flat/recommended-script`, ☑️ `recommended`, 🟢 `recommended-module`, ✅ `recommended-script`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This is similar to [no-unpublished-require](no-unpublished-require.md), but this rule handles `import` declarations.

## 📖 Rule Details

If a source code file satisfies all of the following conditions, the file is \*published\*.

- `"files"` field of `package.json` includes the file or `"files"` field of `package.json` does not exist.
- `.npmignore` does not include the file.

Then this rule warns `import` declarations in \*published\* files if the `import` declaration imports \*unpublished\* files or the packages of `devDependencies`.

> This intends to prevent "Module Not Found" error after `npm publish`.\
> 💡 If you want to import `devDependencies`, please write `.npmignore` or `"files"` field of `package.json`.

### Options

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "n/no-unpublished-import": ["error", {
            "allowModules": [],
            "convertPath": null
        }]
    }
}
```

#### allowModules

This can be configured in the rule options or as a shared setting [`settings.allowModules`](../shared-settings.md#allowmodules).
Please see the shared settings documentation for more information.

#### resolvePaths

This can be configured in the rule options or as a shared setting [`settings.resolvePaths`](../shared-settings.md#resolvepaths).
Please see the shared settings documentation for more information.

#### convertPath

This can be configured in the rule options or as a shared setting [`settings.convertPath`](../shared-settings.md#convertpath).
Please see the shared settings documentation for more information.

### ignoreTypeImport

If using typescript, you may want to ignore type imports. This option allows you to do that.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "n/no-unpublished-import": ["error", {
            "ignoreTypeImport": true
        }]
    }
}
```

In this way, the following code will not be reported:

```ts
import type foo from "foo";
```

### ignorePrivate

In a private package you sometimes want to disable checking for unpublished dependencies, e.g. if the package is not published.

However, there are situations where you want to mark it as private, though still ensure only published dependencies are used in your source code.
An example, for such a case would be a package that is deployed to a server.

Defaults to `true`.

package.json:

```json
{
    "private": true,
    ...
}
```

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "n/no-unpublished-import": ["error", {
            "ignorePrivate": true
        }]
    }
}
```
