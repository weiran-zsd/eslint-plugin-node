# Disallow `import` declarations which import extraneous modules (`n/no-extraneous-import`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): 🟢 `recommended-module`, ✅ `recommended-script`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If an `import` declaration's source is extraneous (it's not written in `package.json`), the program works in local, but will not work after dependencies are re-installed. It will cause troubles to your team/contributors.
This rule disallows `import` declarations of extraneous modules.
